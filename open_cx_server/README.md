# openCX

openCX is an integrated set of apps aimed to improve the collective experience (CX) of participants attending professional conferences, group meetings and public spaces in general.

It explores technologies in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) and multimedia visualization applicable to distributed services and for creating augmented spaces.

These apps are based on the results of the [thesis of Pedro Ayala (Master on Multimedia)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/pub_geral.show_file?pi_doc_id=159427), supervised by Ademar Aguiar and Miguel Carvalhais. 

openCX is planned to be released under an opensource license.

Teams
---
openCX development started in the context of the Software Engineering course of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering ([MIEIC/ESOF](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=436443)), coordinated by [Ademar Aguiar](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=231081), [Filipe Correia](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=486352), and [Rui Neves](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=618538), with contributions from [36 development teams of students](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/fest_geral.fotos_estud_inscritos_list?pv_ocorrencia_id=436443&pv_dimensao_matriz=6) from MIEIC/ESOF course, 2019/20 edition, [2 agile coaches (João Damas and David Reis)](), students from MIEIC/MADS course, 2019/20 edition, and [João Pedro Dias](https://jpdias.me), as IoT expert, doctoral student of ProDEI. 

Process
---
openCX has a strong pedagogical motivation, being a kind of playground for several software engineering practices, blending practices both from traditional processes (e.g. Unified Process) and agile processes (e.g. Extreme Programming).

The development follows a simple iterative process, organized in the four phases of Unified Process (Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition), and encompassing activities not only from Requirements, Design, Implementation, Test, and Deployment disciplines, but also a few other activities from Business Modeling, Change Management, and Project Management.

Documentation
---
During the 12 weeks of initial development under the context of MIEIC/ESOF, each team will produce a [Software Development Report (see template)](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx/blob/master/docs/templates/Development-Report.md), including detailed information organized by Unified Process disciplines: Business Modeling, Requirements, Architecture and Design, Implementation, Test, Change management and Project management.

Tools
---
There are many possibilities to support the process and the production of the documentation required. However, we suggest the following (non-mandatory):
* Github Classroom: source code, models, documentation, and change requests.
* Visual Studio Code: multilanguage code editor.
* Visual Paradigm: UML diagrams.
* Trello: tasks management.
* HackMD: collaborative editor, synced with Github.

Technologies
---
* mobile apps:
    * Flutter
    * React Native
* badge apps:
    * microbit
* things
    * beacons
    * ...
* web servers/web services:
    * RaspberryPi
    * VPS at FEUP
    * ...

Environment
---
The target environment is the upcoming [&lt;Programming&gt; 2020, the 4th International Conference on the Art, Science and Engineering of Programming](https://2020.programming-conference.org), to be held on 23-26 March 2020, at FEUP, Porto, Portugal.


Contributions
---
We encourage contributions from the community to all aspects of the project: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.
